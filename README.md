Very, VERY simple console based text editor. 

Pretty much the first 'from scratch' C++ practice run. 

Should offer simple console interface (with a few humoristic touches here and there),
along with the basic functionalities of:
- Creating a file
- Opening a file
- Word search
- Character count
- Writing to a file
- Deleting a file
- Copying a file
